# Agentic Forex Trading Model

This project is a framework for an agentic Forex trading model that uses a large language model (LLM) to make trading decisions.

## Disclaimer

**Trading Forex carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of investments can fluctuate, and you may lose all of your invested capital. You should not risk more than you are prepared to lose. Before deciding to trade, you should ensure that you understand the risks involved and take into account your level of experience. This is an experimental project and should not be used for live trading without extensive backtesting and validation. It is highly recommended to start with a paper trading (demo) account.**

## Setup

1.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  Configure your API keys and trading parameters in `config.py`.
3.  Run the trading agent:
    ```
    python main.py
